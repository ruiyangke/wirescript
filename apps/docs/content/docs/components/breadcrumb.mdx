title: breadcrumb
description: Breadcrumb navigation trail.
---

Breadcrumb navigation showing the current page hierarchy. Contains `crumb` children.

## Usage

```wire preview
(breadcrumb
  (crumb "Home" :to home)
  (crumb "Products" :to products)
  (crumb "Details"))
```

## Properties

### breadcrumb

<PropsTable element="breadcrumb" />

### crumb

<PropsTable element="crumb" />

The last crumb typically has no `:to` property, indicating the current page. You can also use `:active` to explicitly mark a crumb as the current page.

### Using the :active Flag

```wire preview
(breadcrumb
  (crumb "Home" :to home)
  (crumb "Products" :active)
  (crumb "Details"))
```
