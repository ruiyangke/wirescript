# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2025**

This privacy policy describes how WireScript browser extensions and tools handle your data.

## Chrome Extension: WireScript for GitHub

### Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** The WireScript Chrome Extension:

- Does not collect personal information
- Does not collect usage analytics
- Does not collect browsing history
- Does not track you across websites
- Does not transmit any data to external servers

### Data Processing

All processing happens **locally in your browser**:

- WireScript code is parsed and rendered entirely on your device
- No code or content is sent to any server
- Cached preview images are stored only in browser memory (not persisted)

### Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `https://github.com/*` | Required to read and render WireScript code blocks on GitHub pages |

The extension does **not** request:
- Access to all websites
- Access to browsing history
- Access to cookies or storage
- Access to your tabs
- Background execution permissions

### Data Storage

The extension does not use persistent storage. Temporary data (PNG preview cache) is held in memory only and cleared when:
- You close the tab
- You navigate away from the page
- The browser clears the page from memory

### Third-Party Services

The extension does not integrate with any third-party services. It does not:
- Load external scripts
- Make network requests
- Use analytics services
- Display advertisements

### Source Code

The extension is open source. You can review the code at:
[github.com/ruiyangke/wirescript](https://github.com/ruiyangke/wirescript/tree/main/apps/chrome-extension)

## Obsidian Plugin

The WireScript Obsidian Plugin follows the same principles:

- All rendering is local
- No data collection
- No network requests
- No analytics or tracking

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
