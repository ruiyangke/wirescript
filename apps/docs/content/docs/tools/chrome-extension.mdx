description: Render WireScript wireframes directly in GitHub markdown.
---

The WireScript Chrome Extension renders `wire` code blocks as interactive wireframes on GitHub.

## Features

- Renders wireframes inline in GitHub READMEs, issues, and PRs
- Click to activate interactive mode
- Toggle between code and preview
- Fullscreen view for detailed inspection
- Automatic deactivation when scrolled out of view (saves memory)

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wirescript/pmekhhogjcdhbbnkmlolfidgnlhdicei).

### From Source

```bash
cd apps/chrome-extension
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension:

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder

## Usage

Once installed, the extension automatically detects `wire` code blocks on GitHub:

````markdown
```wire
(wire
  (screen home "Home" :mobile
    (box :center :gap 16 :padding 24
      (text "Hello World" :high)
      (button "Get Started" :primary))))
```
````

The code block will show a placeholder preview. Click to activate the interactive wireframe.

### Controls

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Click placeholder | Activate interactive wireframe |
| Toggle button (`</>`) | Switch between code and preview |
| Fullscreen button | Open in fullscreen modal |
| Esc | Close fullscreen |

### Placeholder States

The extension uses smart loading to minimize resource usage:

1. **Skeleton** - Initial state, shows title and viewport
2. **PNG Preview** - Cached static preview (click to interact)
3. **Interactive** - Full wireframe with navigation

When you scroll away from an active wireframe, it automatically returns to the preview state after 2 seconds.

## Supported Pages

The extension works on:

- Repository README files
- Markdown files (`.md`, `.wire`)
- Issues and pull requests
- Wiki pages
- Gist files

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load

- Make sure you're on a `github.com` page
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions`
- Try refreshing the page

### Code blocks not detected

- The code block must use the `wire` or `wirescript` language identifier
- Check for syntax errors in your WireScript code

### Preview looks wrong

- Try clicking to activate the full interactive mode
- Check the browser console for errors

## Privacy

The extension:

- Only runs on `github.com` pages
- Does not collect or transmit any data
- All rendering happens locally in your browser
- Requests zero special Chrome permissions
